# Josh McAllister's Portfolio

## My name is Josh McAllister and this Portfolio is to give a glimpse into my skills.

I have experience in Java, HTML and CSS.

This portfolio is a collection of all the code I have done up until 18 September 2019.

It contains a HTML/CSS website I had made in 2017 for a school project and a Java program to calculate Dry Cleaner costs I made in 2019.
There will be a readme in each project detailing more about them.
