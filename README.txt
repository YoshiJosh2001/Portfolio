This is my portfolio.

My name is Josh.
I have experience in Java, HTML and CSS.

This portfolio is a collection of all the code I have done up until 22 June 2019.
It contains a HTML/CSS website I had made in 2017 for a school project and a Java program to calculate Dry Cleaner costs I made in 2019.
There will be a readme in each project detailing more about them.
