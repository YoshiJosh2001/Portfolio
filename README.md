# Josh McAllister's Portfolio

My name is Josh McAllister and this Portfolio is to give a glimpse into my skills.

I have experience in Java, HTML and CSS.

This portfolio is a collection of all the code I have done up until 18 September 2019.

It contains a HTML/CSS website I had made in 2017 for a school project. The website was remastered in 2019.

This portfolio also contains a Java program to calculate Dry Cleaner costs I made in 2019, and a Air Conditioner build information entry system I made in 2019.
